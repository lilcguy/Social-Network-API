# Social Network API

## Description

This project was developed for practice in the development of the backend of a hypothetical social network application. This includes user creation, updating, deleting, and searching, whether for all users or one in particular. Users have thoughts, which have search routes, creation, update, and deletion routes. Thoughts have reactions, which have routes to be posted to be associated with a thought. Lastly, there are friendships between users that use POST and DELETE routes to make friendships, and delete them between users. 

This was also practice in using MongoDB as the database of the application in lieu of MYSQL, and using Mongoose in lieu of Sequelize to interface with the database. This project is strictly the backend of the theoretical application. After this project's completion, I feel much more comfortable using .then() and .catch()chains on promises, and using async/await functions, and use them interchangably as I see fit for the problem. And of course, I have familiarized myself with MongoDB and Mongoose as they are used in an application.

## Installation

For installation, run the command ' npm i ' while in the directory to install dependencies for usage.

## Usage

For usage, run the server after installing dependencies with the command 'npm run start'. After starting the server, you can then use Insomnia to hit the routes.

Screenshots of usage are located in the assets folder.
